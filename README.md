# Inventory-Management
This project focuses on developing an efficient and user-friendly Inventory Management System designed to streamline product tracking, monitor stock levels, and manage stock inflows and outflows. The system ensures that businesses maintain optimal inventory levels, preventing both stock shortages and overstocking.

# Key Objectives

- **Accurate Product and Stock Tracking:**  
  Maintain up-to-date records of product details, stock levels, and reorder thresholds to ensure accurate inventory management.  

- **Efficient Stock Movement Monitoring:**  
  Track stock inflows and outflows in real time to prevent discrepancies and improve operational efficiency.  

- **Optimized Inventory Control:**  
  Prevent stockouts and overstocking by maintaining optimal stock levels, reducing holding costs, and ensuring smooth operations.  

- **Automated Stock Calculations:**  
  Calculate key metrics such as available stock, stock value, and monthly inflow/outflow trends to facilitate informed decision-making.  

- **Comprehensive Data Visualization:**  
  Provide a dynamic dashboard that presents a summarized view of inventory status and key performance indicators (KPIs) for better decision-making.

# Key Insights from the Analysis

- **Stock Levels and Reorder Alerts:**  
  Several products are approaching their reorder levels, indicating the need for timely replenishment to avoid stockouts.  

- **High Stock Turnover for Popular Products:**  
  Certain products have a high turnover rate, suggesting consistent demand and the need for frequent restocking.  

- **Overstocking of Low-Demand Items:**  
  Some products show low sales activity, leading to excess stock and increased holding costs.  

- **Imbalance in Inflow and Outflow:**  
  Stock inflow is occasionally higher than outflow, resulting in excess inventory that may lead to storage inefficiencies.  

- **Consistent Invoice and Stock Matching:**  
  The data reflects minimal discrepancies between stock movement and invoices, indicating a well-maintained order fulfillment process.
